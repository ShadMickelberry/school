# Online Applications

Professor M wants to ensure he has a quality pipeline of students for his school.  He has decided to allow prospective
students to apply online.

## Implementation Technique

A [Web to Lead Form](http://support.sugarcrm.com/Knowledge_Base/Campaigns_Target_Lists/Creating_a_Web-to-Lead_Form/) was 
created in Sugar and then customized to become the online application for the school.

## Implementation Details

[ApplyOnline.html](../package/src/custom/online_application_form/ApplyOnline.html) is a 
customized Web to Lead Form.  This form is the online application that students can complete.  When students submit
the form, they are redirected to 
[ApplyOnlineSuccess.html](../package/src/custom/online_application_form/ApplyOnlineSuccess.html), a static html file.

Note that these two files are stored in the 
[custom/online_application_form](../package/src/custom/online_application_form) directory for simplicity of deploying
this example.  You could host these two files on any server.

When the form is submitted, a new Applicant (Lead) record is automatically created in the system.
